The Annotated Stage Project aims to combine all known stage knowledge in an easy-to-read format to increase ease of stage modding in Brawl.
The project adds in MSBIN documentation for every "special" ModelData as well as other useful stage components.

There are currently two ends of the Annotated Stage Project, each with slightly different goals.

## vBrawl (AKA Vanilla or Unmodified Brawl)
- Focuses on providing clean, easy-to-use bases for completely custom stages.
- Annotations are focused on how to control and manipulate the gimmicks of the stage.

## Project M
- Project M: Focuses on providing clean, easy-to-use bases primarily for 1:1s.
- Annotations are focused on how the stage was built and what elements need to be kept intact to make a 1:1 of the stage.
- Currently out of date. [A better repository can be found here.](https://github.com/soopercool101/Stage-Templates-1to1s)
